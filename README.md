The config file has parameters that you can change and settings that you can set to true or false depending on how much data you want to see from the test runs and the final run display. The run data might become inaccurate if the grid is changed, because what constitutes a "perfect run" is somewhat hard-coded, but the algorithm will still work, and the visualizer will still display the correct route.
